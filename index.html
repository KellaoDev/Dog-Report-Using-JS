            The Lhasa Apso are very furry, small dogs (from 24 to 25 cm in height), calm and with a strong personality. Despite their small size, Lhasa Apsos can be watchdogs as they are always alert and bark in the presence of strangers. They are very protective and when well trained they are extremely obedient. Despite the similarity, the Lhasas have a longer muzzle than the Shih Tzu and a slightly narrower skull.
